 # BW Insurance
 
 This project is Docker-based, and uses [ddev](https://github.com/drud/ddev) for local development.  To use, you must:"
 
- Install ddev
- Clone the repository
- Copy the file `.ddev/.env` to `.ddev/.env.local`, and supply values for the variables contained therein.
- Run `ddev start`.

Once you have done this, the output of the last command will tell you where your site will be visible.
You should be able to login using the username 'admin', and the
password '123456'.
